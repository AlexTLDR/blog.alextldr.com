## What's the goal of this series?

This is my journey to learning Rust. A short intro about me, I am Alex, a self-taught Go
developer, with an interest in DevOps and Linux. I try staying engaged with the local community by hosting the local Go
meetup, [Stuttgart Gophers](https://stuttgart-gophers.de).

I still love Go, but I've recently become curious about Rust. I started playing with Rust in September or October
2025, but life happens, and in one way or another, I keep getting distracted with other projects.

I believe that by writing this blog series, I can keep track of my progress, share my opinions, and
Most importantly, stay motivated to learn Rust by maintaining consistency.

Besides the learning materials, which I will share along the evolution of the blog, doing exercises and
small projects (as this is the best way to learn), I want to use the Zettelkasten Methodology to organize,
take notes and keep track of my process.

Regarding my commitment to updating the blog, I will commit to weekly posts, except for holiday 
periods in which it is possible that I will skip a week.

## What is the Zettelkasten Methodology?

The [Zettelkasten Methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) is a note-taking system popularized by the 
German philosopher and sociologist Niklas Luhmann. It is based on the idea of creating a personal database of notes, 
called Zettels, that are connected to each other through links. The Zettelkasten Methodology is a way to
organize your thoughts and ideas in a way that is flexible, scalable, and easy to use.

## [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

I want to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my Zettels as it already uses Markdown under the hood (the same as this 
blog that is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)), has a great graph view, and has a free tier. It also has a great Git 
integration, which I use for backup purposes, as my Zettels evolve.

Searching the internet, there are many guids regarding how to setup Obsidian for a Zettelkasten, but I will
share the one that I found the most vanilla: [How to Use Obsidian as a Zettelkasten: The Ultimate Tutorial](https://mattgiaro.com/obsidian-zettelkasten/).

TL;DR: Don't focus on complex setups, as the whole idea is to be productive and not waste time with a lot of configs. I 
believe that everybody has its own way of working, and that with time, you'll have your own personalized Zettelkasten
workflow.

Below is my current Obsidian schema:

## Final words

As English is not my native language, please excuse my mistakes. The best way of learning is by writing, so I will 
write this series without AI generation. The whole scope of this series is for me to write about Rust, consolidate my learning, 
and share my thoughts on the blog.
