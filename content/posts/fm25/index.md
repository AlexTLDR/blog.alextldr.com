# [FM26](https://www.footballmanager.com/fm26)

## Don't
- I bought it from [fmscout](https://www.fmscout.com/)
- I waited for the beta
- played the beta
- was disappointed
- played the release
- even though it is not a beta, it feels like an alpha
- Sports Interactive tries to go console
- They ruined the game for all
- Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game to anyone
- I regret buying it, and since I didn't buy it on Steam, I can't refund it
- even the editor is unintuitive
## Do
- off-the-ball tactics
- I like more the match UI
- it loads very fast, and week/match proceedings are fast (but since the game is dumbed down, the ammount of data to load is less)
- it works better on Linux (praise Steam for this) than Windows

### Conclusion
- Play FM24 instead
- I never thought I would have to write a blog post to express my disappointment regrading my most loved game franchise. I feel so old to write this...

*I am sorry for the hate post, but [FM26](https://www.footballmanager.com/fm26) seems to be vibe coded. For me personally,
after playing [FM24](https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-2024-out-now) for 2 years, I would stick with it,
and if bored, learn to program in [Go](https://go.dev/) or [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/).*  
*Maybe I am a grown up and had too many expectations from [Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Jacobson). But my
favorite franchise's direction is heading towards a low point. [FM](https://www.footballmanager.com/) hope you improve. 
For sure, next year [I](https://alextldr.dev/), I will not preorder anymore*
